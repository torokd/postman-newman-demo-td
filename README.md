# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Welcome!

So glad you're here! This little project is a playful, practical demo to help you get comfy with API testing using **Postman** and **Newman**. Whether you're learning, experimenting, or just browsing, youâ€™re in the right place. ðŸš€

---

## ðŸ‘€ What is this project?

This is a **Postman + Newman demo** based on the public [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com) API â€” a free-to-use mock API created by a developer for learning and testing purposes. 

ðŸ“š API documentation for DummyJSON is available here: [https://dummyjson.com/docs](https://dummyjson.com/docs)

---

## ðŸš€ Quick start

There are two main ways to use this project:

### Option 1 â€“ Just want to try it in Postman?

1. Download the collection file:  
   [`DummyJSON.postman_collection.json`](./collection/DummyJSON.postman_collection.json)

2. (Optional) Download the environment file:  
   [`DummyJSON.postman_environment.json`](./environment/DummyJSON.postman_environment.json)

3. Import both into Postman and you're ready to click and explore requests manually!

4. You can also run it from the terminal using **Postman CLI** if installed:
   ```bash
   postman collection run DummyJSON.postman_collection.json -e DummyJSON.postman_environment.json
